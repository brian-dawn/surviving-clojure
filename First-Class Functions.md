# First-Class Functions

As we have seen in the previous section, Clojure provides all of the data types usually found in programming languages: numbers, strings, composites data structures... But Clojure also supports the function as a data type.

We say that functions are first-class because they can be used as any other values. A function in Clojure can be:

* created on demand,
* stored in a data structure,
* be passed as an argument to a function, and
* be returned as the value of a function.

## How to create functions on demand?

Clojure provides a series of functions to create other functions:

* comp
* partial
* complement
* memoize

## Closure
