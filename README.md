# Surviving Clojure

## Introduction

This document is composed of 3 parts.

The first part, brick laying, focuses on programming with Clojure in the small: the primitive and composite data types of the language, the functional style of programming, immutability, and the Java interoperability.

The second part, architecture, presents the concepts provided by Clojure to organize large programs: first-class functions, polymorphism, and macros.

Finally, the last part will present some of the tools to manage Clojure projects.
