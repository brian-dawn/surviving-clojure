# Surviving Clojure

## Introduction

This document is composed of 3 parts. The first part focuses on programming with Clojure in the small: the dynamic aspect of Clojure and the REPL, the functional style of programming and immutability, and the Java interoperability.

The second part, architecture, presents the concepts provided by Clojure to organize large programs: first-class functions, polymorphism, and macros.

Finally, the last part will present some of the tools to manage Clojure projects.
