# Surviving Clojure

## Introduction

This document is composed of 3 parts. The first part focuses on programming with Clojure in the small: the dynamic aspect of Clojure and the REPL, the functional style of programming and Clojure's immutabile data structures, and the Java interoperability. The second part presents the concepts provided by Clojure to organize large programs: polymorphism and macros. Finally, the last part will present some of the tools and documentation for Clojure projects.

## Programming in the Small

* [Clojure is Dynamic](Clojure is Dynamic.md)
* [Functional Programming and Immutability](Functional Programming.md)
* [Java Interoperability](Java Interoperability.md)

## Programming in the Large

* [Polymorphism](Polymorphism.md)
* [Macros](Macros.md)
* Mutation and Concurrency (This topic is covered in "Threading in Clojure".)

## Tools and Documentation

* [Leiningen](leiningen.md)
* [The Clojure Namespace](Clojure Namespace.md)
