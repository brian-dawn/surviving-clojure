### The Sequence Interface

Many Clojure functions work on the Sequence abstraction: first, rest, cons.

That is one of the great benefits of Clojure and Lisps in general. The list structure, or Seq interface, provides a uniform interface between programs.

For an exhaustive list of functions on sequences, see the [page about sequences on the Clojure website.](http://clojure.org/sequences).
